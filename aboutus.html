Hi, I’m Farrah — and this is Farrah1Love’s Podcast. This space is all about real talk: Love, Marriage, Relationships, Family, and Life Advice.

My background started with my BA in Business management, which helped me learn to socialize and network with different people from all walks of life. I’ve always had a passion to help other’s which stemmed from watching my mother care for others as a family doctor. I inhereted this inante and intutive way with people being drawn to me since I genuinely care for people, what they’ve gone through in life and help them plan out their future. I started streaming on social media in 2017 where I connected with people on public panels all over the world. Along the way, I picked up an interest in psychology, and most importantly, I became a listener. A connector.
This podcast isn’t about lectures or perfect answers — it’s about stories, conversations, and the lessons we pick up along the way. Whether you’re single, navigating love, or just figuring out life, you’ll find honest, unfiltered talks here.

So grab your headphones, settle in, and let’s explore life together — one episode at a time. </p>
